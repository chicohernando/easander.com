                I went through a 40 hour leadership training course once I became a Manager at HomeFinder.com.  I received the training in 2009 and it was conducted by Bill Joy, Founder of <a href="http://www.thejoygroup.com/">The Joy Group</a>.  Honestly, I was reluctant about having to spend an entire week at a training session, but in the end I was 100% satisfied with what I learned.  I highly recommend The Joy Group to anyone that is looking for great leadership/management training.
