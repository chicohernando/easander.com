              <p>
                I went through a 40 hour leadership training course once I became a Manager at HomeFinder.com.  I received the training in 2009 and it was conducted by Bill Joy, Founder of <a href="http://www.thejoygroup.com/">The Joy Group</a>.  Honestly, I was reluctant about having to spend an entire week at a training session, but in the end I was 100% satisfied with what I learned.  I highly recommend The Joy Group to anyone that is looking for great leadership/management training.

              <p>
                I was recruited as one of the first Americans to complete a six month training and work program in Mysore and Bangalore, India. This training strengthened technical skills in various areas including Java, J2EE, C, unit testing, and SQL. During this period I also gained hands on experience with the Global Delivery Model as well as the Software Development Life Cycle.

              <p>
                Once I returned to the United States I was contracted to ABN-AMRO / LaSalle Bank in the LaSalle Business Credit division. While working there I provided application support for the Asset Based Lending Environment (ABLE) application. I also coordinated software updates and installations while using tools such as Peregrine and Test Director to manage tasks with the client and IBM.
